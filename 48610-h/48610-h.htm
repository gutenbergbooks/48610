<h2>PICNIC SAM.</h2>

<h3>BY WILL CARLETON.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">You youngsters who haven't heard of Picnic Sam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Just huddle up around here where I am,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And listen sharp while memory wanders to him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And brings out what he seemed like when I knew him.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He lived in one of those high-stretched affairs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Called tenements, up any amount of stairs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His room there, when the tired streets he forsook,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Was just what room he crowded in and took.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Though he "lived high," he never had the gout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And for the most part took his dinners out;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Breakfast and supper were not in his way;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His motto always was, One meal per day;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Or rather, maybe, when you squarely met it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">One meal per day, providing I can get it.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His garments&mdash;well, you've stood and looked, perhaps,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 14em;">At those plump, little, beaming, made-up chaps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With nobby coats, and smiling painted faces,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">The clothing dealer in his window places</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">(To make <i>meat</i> children envious, I suppose):</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Well, Sam wasn't dressed at all like one of those.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Raiment like his no lively lad enjoys;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">It had been cut for several different boys;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And, taking garments as they come and go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He had about one suit&mdash;or nearly so.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Still, dry-goods are of life a small-sized part:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A bad coat often hides a first-class heart.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His face suggested, to the casual sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A bull-dog's when he's waiting for a fight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And on it might be traced full many a streak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As though it were not laundered once a week.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And yet his eyes were handsome, for a fact</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">(That is, of course, the one that was not blacked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">For he had fighting&mdash;more or less&mdash;to do);</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But his well eye looked rather good and true.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">You youngsters, huddle round here where I am&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I'll tell you why they called him Picnic Sam.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">This young home heathen had, by day and night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A regular first-class picnic appetite;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And, with a zeal good children stood in fear of,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Attended every picnic he could hear of.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">When Sunday-schools were going to have "a spread,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He'd always join, a week or two ahead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And though no "verses" he had ever learned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Tried to look serious like and deep concerned,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And (if some good boy he was sitting near)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Would answer every question, loud and clear.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">'Twas strange, when near the time of feasting came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">How sure a school was to get Samuel's name.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"Why," said a teacher, rather prone to scoff,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"He'll smell a picnic full a fortnight off."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">'Twas strange, in different schools he ravaged round in,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">What various kinds of classes he'd be found in.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Three times he actually tried to pass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As member of an old folks' Bible class;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And once appeared (rough brick-bat among pearls)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">In a small timid infant class of girls!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But in whatever company he came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His appetite stood by him all the same.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">No picnic near, in weather foul or pleasant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But Sam and stomach managed to be present.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And when, with innocent, unconscious air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He placed himself at table, firm and square,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With one eye partly closed, the other looking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Intently at the different styles of cooking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And when, with savage-gleaming knife and fork,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He brought himself down seriously to work,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And marched through every dish in conquering glory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And ravaged all the adjacent territory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Making the table for some distance round</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Look like a fiercely hard-fought battle-ground,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A smile upon his placid face would fall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As if life wasn't a failure, after all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">But when the exciting dinner hour was gone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam always felt quite uncalled-for and alone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Felt snubbed and frozen and made quiet game of&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Slights that he didn't even know the name of,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But which he sensed as keenly (do not doubt it)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As if some foe had told him all about it.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He always felt by that vague feeling haunted</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">That hangs around folks when they are not wanted.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Because a boy is greedy, dull, and droll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">It needn't follow that he hasn't a soul;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Because his stomach craves more than its part,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">It's no sign he was born without a heart;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Though ragged, poor, or coarse, or impolite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He may resent a wrong or feel a slight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">'Tis dangerous work, this making game of folks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Thinking, perhaps, they do not heed your jokes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Don't fool yourself; for, ten to one, they know it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And feel it worse in laboring not to show it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Well, on one day particularly fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam felt himself invited to help dine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">In a small grove, green, shady, fresh, and cool,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A recently discovered Sunday-school:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Which, when he'd joined, he'd muttered, "This'll pass;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">It's a swell crowd; the board'll be first-class."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And so it was; and for an hour or more</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam slew things as he never did before.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Wondering, with a gastronomic smile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Where all these victuals'd been all this long while;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And made the teachers feel a great surprise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">That they'd so underrated their supplies;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And in his stomach could not but confess</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">That life to-day was one good square success.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Then, after dinner, feeling perk and smart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He tried to make a little social start,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And frisk and frolic round, like any other,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And be accepted as a boy and brother.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But all the children shrank, with scarce-hid loathing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">From a strange lad in such imperfect clothing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And soon Sam's face a misty sadness wore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">As if to say, "I b'lieve I'm snubbed once more."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He tried to put them under obligations</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With street accomplishments and fascinations:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">In turning somersaults and hand-springs led,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Whistled and sang, danced, stood upon his head;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Even tried a friendly sparring match, till taken</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Right in the act, misunderstood, and shaken</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">(By the strong mother of the lad he battled),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Till the provisions in him fairly rattled.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But whatsoe'er he did, discreet or bold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">It seemed to drive him further in the cold.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">The grove was near a river; on whose brink</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Samuel sat down, with lots of time to think,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And watch some light boats swiftly past him go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With happy children flitting to and fro,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Content to see <i>him</i> safe and dry on land.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And he thought, "No, I ain't much in demand."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Just then a trim young miss came tripping by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With golden hair, and more than handsome eye;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And Sam remarked, his face full of glad creases,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"That's the smart girl that scooped 'em speakin' pieces;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I wonder if she learned hers like a song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Or made the speech up as she went along.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">She came out first, though last upon the track,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But spoke so long it held the dinner back;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Still, what she said was sweet an' soothin' rather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">'Bout how 'We all are children of one Father.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">If that's so, she's half-sister unto me&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">At least I think I'll speak to her, and see."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Then, thinking pleasantly to clear the way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He shouted, "Miss, this 'ere's a pleasant day."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But she flounced on, more haughty than before;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And Sam remarked, "I b'lieve I'm snubbed once more."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">While, roughly sad, the boy sat musing yet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He heard a shout, "Help! help! our boat's upset!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And following with his eyes the fear-edged scream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam saw three children struggling in the stream.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And two were rescued; one went 'neath a wave;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">The waters closed above her like a grave.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">She sank, apparently to rise no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">While frantic crowds ran up and down the shore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And, 'mid the turmoil, each one did his best,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Shouting first-class instructions to the rest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"It's the swell girl," thought Sam, "that's made this row;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I wonder how she likes the weather now.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I'd save her&mdash;if it wasn't too much bother&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">'Good deeds for evil&mdash;children of one Father.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I rather think she's gone down there to stay;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">She can't be <i>yelled</i> up, if they try all day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Wonder, if I should save her, 'twould be bold.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I've dove for pennies&mdash;s'pose I dive for gold."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Then throwing off his coat&mdash;what there was of it&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He plunged into the water, rose above it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Plunged in again, and came once more to air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Grasping a pretty golden tress of hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And a fine, stylish, shapely girl attached,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With pale, sweet face, and lips that with it matched.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He held her up till strong arms came from shore;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And soon she raised her eyes, and lived once more.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">But Sam, poor boy, exhausted, choked, and beaten</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 14em;">With the prodigious dinner he had eaten,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Strangled and sank beneath the river's brim;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And no one seemed to care to dive for him.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Indeed, 'twas hard from the cold waves to win him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">With such a large part of the picnic in him;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And when at last he came out with "a haul,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">The school had one dead pupil, after all.</span><br />
</p>

<span class="caption">"POOR DRENCHED, DEAD HERO."</span>
</div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Poor drenched, dead hero!&mdash;in his tattered dress</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam now was a society success.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">They crowded round the dead boy as he lay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And talked about him in a mournful way;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And from the teachers efforts did not lack</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">To resurrect and bring their scholar back:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">They thronged about him, kept from him the air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Founded him, pumped him, shook him up with care;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">But useless was their toil, do all they could:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Sam and his dinner had gone on for good.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Nothing too nice that could be done and said</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">For this poor fellow&mdash;now that he was dead.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">His casket was the finest and the best:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">He went to his own funeral richly dressed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">They rigged him out in very pretty trim;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A rich, first-class procession followed him,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">That reached the farthest distance up and down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Of any often witnessed in that town;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And all the children, shedding tears half-hid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Threw evergreens upon Sam's coffin lid.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">Now when you're tempted scornfully to smile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">If a poor boy doesn't come up to your style,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Or shrink from him as though perhaps he'll bite you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Because he has some points that don't delight you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Or think, because your "set" can do without him,</span><br />

<h3>[Written for the Young People's Natural History Society.]</h3>

<h3>BY GEORGE CARY EGGLESTON.</h3>

<h2>THE BABY ELEPHANT'S NUT-CRACKER.</h2>

<p>I suppose every reader of <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> has seen an elephant eat
pea-nuts. Of course every boy who goes to a show has pea-nuts in his
pocket, because pea-nuts seem somehow to be a part of the show.
Sometimes I think they are almost a part of the boy, for that matter.
Well, having pea-nuts in one's pocket, and being inside the show, it is
quite a matter of course to feed pea-nuts to the elephant. The fun lies
in the ridiculous difference of size between the pea-nut and the
elephant; it seems in a high degree absurd that so huge a creature
should care for so small a thing to eat, and the wonder is that the
elephant does not lose the nut somewhere in his great mouth. If he could
get pea-nuts by the pint, instead of singly, the wonder would be less.</p>

<p>But how many boys and girls ever saw the baby elephant eat pea-nuts? He
does it in a way entirely different from that of his father and mother.
He does not like the shells, and so he cracks the nuts as carefully as
any boy does, and his method of doing this is as curious as anything
about him. I found out his trick by accident one day, when the baby
elephant was a very little fellow indeed, weighing not more than five
hundred pounds or so. I had taken three boys with me to the show, and of
course each of us had a pocket full of pea-nuts. When we came to inspect
the baby elephant, we offered him a nut. He took it with the fingers at
the end of that wonderful trunk of his, but did not place it in his
mouth, as his father or mother would have done. He laid it on the ground
instead, and raising one of his great clumsy-looking feet, swept it
backward so near the ground as to catch the nut between the foot and the
hard earth, cracking it very neatly without crushing it. He knew enough
not to step on the nut, and he used his foot so dextrously that a single
stroke separated the kernel from the shell. Then he picked up the kernel
with his trunk, put it in his mouth, and ate it with as keen a relish as
if he had been a boy at recess.</p>

<p>This performance was so entertaining that we repeated it again and
again. The elephant was willing enough, and before long all the boys and
girls in that part of the show had gathered around us to see the
strangely intelligent act. We boys (for I am always a boy when I am with
boys at a show) fed Master Baby Elephant all the pea-nuts we had&mdash;there
was a quart of them distributed among us&mdash;and when we got through,
others took our places.</p>

<p>We had to go through that show without any pea-nuts to eat, but we had
found out how the baby elephant manages to use his great clumsy-looking
foot for a nut-cracker.</p>

<p>Now there are two or three things that puzzle me about this matter. I
want to know how the baby elephant learned to crack his pea-nuts.
Instinct? Well, that is a good word with which to pretend that we
explain things that we do not understand, but it will scarcely answer in
this case. In their wild state elephants have no boys to give them
pea-nuts, and as a matter of fact they have no instinct about pea-nuts.
The baby elephant did not learn this from the grown-up elephants, for
they do not crack their nuts. I wonder if he imitated some boy whom he
saw cracking a nut with his heel.</p>

<p>Another thing I am curious about. Will the baby elephant go on cracking
his nuts in this way when he becomes a grown-up elephant? The grown-up
elephants do nothing of the kind. If he does not continue the practice,
and so become an exceptional fellow, but leaves it off after a while, at
what age will he make the change, and why will he change? If he prefers
cracked to uncracked nuts one day, why should he prefer the uncracked
ones the next day? I wish I could work this puzzle out by going to the
show every day, and feeding the baby elephant with pea-nuts until he
grows up or changes his way of eating them. Perhaps the members of the
Young People's Natural History Society through the country will keep up
a series of observations until the matter is settled.</p>

<h4>A POISONOUS FOOD-PLANT.</h4>

<p>There is a shrub called manioc, or manihot, or cassava, which grows in
South America, the West Indies, and Africa. It has a great bulbous root,
and it is this root which is interesting. In that species of the plant
which is most used the root has a bitter, acrid juice, which is deadly
poisonous. The strange part of the matter is that both the root and the
poisonous juice are used for food, and probably every boy or girl who
reads this has eaten both.</p>

<p>The natives of hot countries dry the root, and make good wholesome bread
out of it. It is only the juice which is poisonous or disagreeable in
taste. But the juice itself contains a kind of starch, and when the
liquid parts of it are evaporated, there remains&mdash;what do you think?
Why, the tapioca of which your mother makes puddings.</p>

<p>But why isn't tapioca poisonous? Why is Brazilian arrowroot&mdash;which is
only the manioc root dried and powdered&mdash;harmless and nutritive? What
becomes of the poison, and how can we be sure that none of it remains in
the tapioca or the arrowroot?</p>

<p>Pour a spoonful of alcohol on a plate, and set it in the air or
sunshine. Then look for it half an hour afterward. The plate will be
dry, and not even a smell of the alcohol will remain. Liquids which
evaporate easily and completely in this way are called volatile, and the
acid which renders manioc root poisonous is extremely volatile. When the
least heat is applied to any mixture containing it, the acid quickly and
completely evaporates, and that is the way in which it disappears in the
process of making tapioca, or drying the root to make arrowroot of it.
There is a small quantity of bitter material in the manioc juice which
is removed by washing the tapioca as soon as it is made.</p>

<h3>BY A.&nbsp;W. ROBERTS.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 189px;">
<img src="images/ill_004.jpg" width="189" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When visiting the sea-shore for the purpose of gathering sea-weeds, or
to learn something of their modest and simple lives, it will be noticed
that twice in every twenty-four hours the water advances and recedes,
affording an opportunity for the collector to follow the beach down to
the lowest tide-mark, and thus make sure of some small portion of the
beautiful marine vegetation of the wondrous ocean.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="158" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first band or zone of sea-weeds encountered is that of the coarse
olive-green sea-weeds commonly called bladder-weed or rock-weed. This
alga is easily distinguished by the double series of round air-vessels
with which the fronds are studded, and the coarse midrib running up the
centre of each frond. On all rocky coasts several varieties of this
family of sea-weeds are to be met with. When trodden on, the air-vessels
explode with a sharp report; from this fact it has been christened, by
young people living on the coast, the snap-weed, to whom it affords much
amusement. On this coarse weed, and under its dark and damp masses, in
the tide pools and on the rocks on which it grows, are to be found many
varieties of our most delicate and beautiful sea-weeds.</p>

<p>After the olive-green zone has been passed, the bright greens, brilliant
reds, and purples are reached.</p>

<p>Sea-weeds are rootless plants, and do not derive their support from the
earth, as do other plants, but obtain their entire subsistence from the
water. The small flat disk to be found on the end of the main branch is
only for the purpose of adhering to the rocks, stones, or other objects
on which they may be found attached.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 157px;">
<img src="images/ill_006.jpg" width="157" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have figured five of the most beautiful types of sea-weeds common on
our coast, but they are so learnedly and scientifically named (being
without common names), as, for instance, <i>Polysephonia urceolata</i>, that
I have depended on the simple figures to enlist the reader's interest,
and have avoided the discouraging scientific names.</p>

<p>On many of the apple stands in the city of New York may be seen a dark
purple-colored substance for sale; this is a sea-weed imported from the
coast of Ireland, and is called sloake, or lava. By many it is
considered as great a delicacy as pea-nuts. When mounted, it makes a
very handsome specimen. The best paper for mounting the sea-weeds is
ordinary drawing-paper, cut to a uniform size.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ill_007.jpg" width="300" height="263" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the specimens have been thoroughly washed, the finest should be
separated from the coarser ones, and placed in wide and shallow dishes
filled with clean fresh water. Sheets of the drawing-paper are slipped
under the specimens, which are arranged in a natural and graceful
position as they float over the immersed paper. A camel's-hair brush and
a coarse needle, with the assistance of the fingers, are all that are
required for the arranging of the sea-weeds on the paper. When the
specimen is in proper position, it is slowly and carefully lifted from
the water on the drawing-paper, so as to retain the desired position of
the sea-weed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/ill_008.jpg" width="229" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The mounted specimen should be pinned up for a few minutes to allow the
water to drip off before placing it in the press. There is no need of
fastening the plants to the paper, as most of the sea-weeds are supplied
with a glue-like material which fastens them firmly to the paper when in
the press drying.</p>

<p>The most simple and cheap sea-weed press that I know of consists of two
large boards, as shown in Fig. 1, at AA, and on the lower board (A) are
placed layers of blotting-paper with layers of clean-washed pieces of
old sheeting. The sheeting and blotting-paper layers are for the purpose
of quickly absorbing all moisture from the sea-weeds. As soon as the
water has dripped off the mounted specimen, it is carefully laid on two
or three thicknesses of blotting-paper; on the face of the sea-weed a
piece of the muslin or sheeting is laid; over the sheeting more blotters
are placed, and on this second layer of blotters another set of
sea-weeds. In this way all the specimens are disposed of, and the top
board (AA) is placed; on this a soap box is placed, which is filled with
either sand or stones, by means of which the desired pressure is
obtained.</p>

<p>For a field press, the most simple form that I know of is shown in Fig.
2, which is made out of two pieces of three-quarter inch stuff, well
strengthened with a frame of black walnut, fastened with three screws in
each corner. After the sea-weeds are placed in position on one of the
boards, the top board is laid on, and the specimens are brought under
pressure by means of a stout strap. During the stormy days of next
winter, when you are confined to the house, you will find real pleasure
in arranging your pretty specimens in an album.</p>

<h2>TIM AND TIP;</h2>

<h3>OR, THE ADVENTURES OF A BOY AND A DOG.</h3>

<h3>BY JAMES OTIS,</h3>

<p class="center">AUTHOR OF "TOBY TYLER," ETC.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span>.</h3>

<h3>SAM, THE FAT BOY.</h3>

<p>Tim stopped as quickly as if he had stepped into a pool of glue, which
had suddenly hardened and held him prisoner, and peered anxiously ahead,
trying to discover where the voice came from.</p>

<p>"Didn't know there was anybody round here, did yer?" continued the
voice, while the body still remained hidden from view.</p>

<p>Again Tim tried to discover the speaker, and failing in the attempt, he
asked, in a sort of frightened desperation, "Who are you anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Call off yer dog, and I'll show yer."</p>

<p>These words made Tim feel very much braver, for they showed that the
speaker as well as himself was frightened, and he lost no time in
reducing Tip to a state of subjection by clasping him firmly around the
neck.</p>

<p>"Now come out; he wouldn't hurt a fly, an' it's only his way to bark
when he's kinder scared."</p>

<p>Thus urged, the party afraid of the dog came out of his place of hiding,
which was none other than the branches of a tree, by simply dropping to
the ground&mdash;a proceeding which gave another shock to the nerves of both
Tim and Tip.</p>

<p>But there was nothing about him very alarming, and when Tim had a full
view of him, he was inclined to be angry with himself for having allowed
so short a boy to frighten him. He was no taller than Tim, and as near
as could be seen in the dim light, about as broad as he was long&mdash;a
perfect ball of jelly, with a face, two legs, and two arms carved on it.</p>

<p>It was impossible to gain a good view of his face, but that did not
trouble Tim, who was only anxious to learn who this boy was, and whether
he might be sufficiently acquainted with Captain Babbige to send him
news of the runaway.</p>

<p>The new-comer did not appear to be in any hurry to begin the
conversation, but stood with his hands in his pockets, eying Tim as
though he was some strange animal who might be expected to cut up queer
sort of antics at any moment.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Tim, after he thought the fat boy had looked at him quite
as long as was necessary.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" was the reply.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Outer that tree there," replied the boy, gravely, as he pointed to the
place where he had been hiding.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw you come out of there; but that ain't where you live, is
it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" And Tim was beginning to think that it required a
great deal of labor to extract a small amount of knowledge from this fat
party.</p>

<p>"Oh, I live over the hill, about half a mile down the road. Got anything
good to eat?"</p>

<p>The question seemed so unnecessary and out of place, considering all the
circumstances, that Tim took no notice of it, but asked, "What's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Sam."</p>

<p>"Sam what?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, but I guess it's Simpson."</p>

<p>"Well, you're funny, if you ain't sure what your name is," said Tim,
thoughtfully, forgetting his own troubles in his curiosity about this
queer specimen. "What makes you think your name's Simpson?"</p>

<p>"'Cause that's my father's name."</p>

<p>By this time Tim had released his hold of Tip's neck, and the dog walked
around Sam on a sort of smelling tour, very much to the boy's
discomfort.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said Tim; "he won't bite you. He's the best dog in
the world if you only let him alone."</p>

<p>"I'll let him alone," replied Sam, still in doubt as to Tip's good
intentions&mdash;"I'll let him alone, an' I wish he'd let me alone."</p>

<p>"He's only kinder gettin' acquainted, that's all. Say, do you s'pose
your father would let me sleep in his barn to-night?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. What do you want to for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I ain't got any other place."</p>

<p>If Sam hadn't been so fat, he would probably have started in surprise;
but as it was, he expressed his astonishment by a kind of grunt, and
going nearer to Tim he asked, "Where do you live?'</p>

<p>"Nowhere. Me an' Tip are tryin' to find some place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span> where we can earn
our own livin'," replied Tim, in doubt as to whether he ought to tell
this boy his whole story or not.</p>

<p>"Ain't you got any father or mother?"</p>

<p>"No," was the sad reply. "They're both dead, an' me an' Tip have to look
out for ourselves. We did live with Captain Babbige, but we couldn't
stand it any longer, an' so we started out on our own hook."</p>

<p>"Where do you get things to eat?"</p>

<p>"We've got some money to buy 'em with."</p>

<p>"How much you got?"</p>

<p>"I had two cents when I left Selman, an' Mr. Sullivan, that keeps a
store down to the mills, gave me two dollars."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what let's do," said Sam, eagerly, as his eyes sparkled
with delight. "Jest the other side of my house there's a store, an' we
can go down there an' get two big sticks of candy, an' have an awful
good time."</p>

<p>Tim reflected a moment. He knew that he ought to keep his money; but
Sam's idea seemed such a good one that the thought of the pleasure which
would come with the eating of the candy was too much for his notions of
economy; therefore he compromised by saying, "I will, if you'll let me
sleep in your barn."</p>

<p>Sam quickly agreed to that (in order to get the candy he would probably
have promised to give the entire farm away), and the three&mdash;Sam, Tim,
and Tip&mdash;started off, the best of friends.</p>

<p>But before they had gone very far, Sam stopped in the middle of the
road, as he said, mournfully, "My! but I forgot all about the cow."</p>

<p>"What cow?"</p>

<p>"Father sent me down here to find old Whiteface, an' I forgot all about
her when I saw you."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you find her now? Me an' Tip will help you."</p>

<p>"But it'll take so long, an' before we get back the store will be shut
up," objected Sam, who stood undecided in the road, as if he had half a
mind to leave old Whiteface to her fate while he made sure of the candy.</p>

<p>"Never mind if the store is shut up," said Tim, earnestly. "We can get
the candy just as well in the morning, an' perhaps we'll find her so
quick that there'll be plenty of time."</p>

<p>"Will you buy the candy in the mornin' if you don't to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, honest."</p>

<p>"Cross your throat."</p>

<p>Tim went through the ceremony of crossing his throat to make his promise
more solemn, and search was made for the cow.</p>

<p>Up to this time it was plain that Sam did not feel any great amount of
love for or confidence in Tip; but when, after a few moments' search,
his loud bark told that he had discovered the missing cow, his future
was assured so far as Sam Simpson was concerned.</p>

<p>"Now that's somethin' like," he said, after they had started homeward.
"When you've got such a dog as that, all a feller's got to do is to sit
down an' send him after 'em. It's the awfulest hateful thing in the
world to go off huntin' cows when you don't want to."</p>

<p>Tim had many and serious doubts as to whether Tip could be depended on
to go for the cows alone, but he did not think it best to put those
doubts in words, lest he should deprive his pet of his new-found friend.</p>

<p>It was only a ten minutes' walk to Sam's home, and when the cow had been
led to her stall Tim proposed that Sam should ask permission for him to
sleep in the barn.</p>

<p>"There's time enough for that when we come back," was Sam's reply, the
thought of the candy he was to have in case they reached the store
before it was closed for the night driving all else from his mind. "Come
on; we'll catch Mr. Coburn if we hurry."</p>

<p>Now Tim would much rather have had the question settled as to his
sleeping quarters before starting out for pleasure; but Sam was so eager
for the promised feast that he felt obliged to do as he said, more
especially since it was through his influence that he hoped to receive
the favor.</p>

<p>Naturally Sam Simpson was not a quick-motioned boy, but no one could
have complained of the speed with which he went toward Mr. Coburn's
store that night, and Tim found it hard work to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>The store was open, but the proprietor was just making preparations for
closing. The candy, placed in two rather dirty glass jars, was in its
accustomed place, and beamed down upon them in all its sticky sweetness,
delighting Sam simply by the view to such an extent that his face was
covered with smiles.</p>

<p>With a gravity befitting the occasion and the amount of wealth he was
about to squander, Tim asked to be allowed to see the goods he proposed
to buy, in order to make sure they were of the proper length.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Coburn rubbed his glasses carefully, wiped his face as a sort of
preface to his task, and set about making this last sale of the day with
the air of a man who knows he is called upon to deal with very exacting
customers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/ill_011.jpg" width="307" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">PEPPERMINT, OR LEMON?</span>
</div>

<p>It was fully five minutes before Tim could settle the weighty question
as to whether it was better to buy a stick of peppermint and one of
lemon, and thus by dividing them get two distinct treats, or to take
both of one kind, and thus prevent any dispute as to whether he had made
a just and equal division.</p>

<p>While this struggle was going on in the purchaser's mind, Sam fidgeted
around, standing first on one foot and then on the other, watching every
movement Tim made, while Tip searched over every portion of the store,
very much to Mr. Coburn's annoyance.</p>

<p>The decision was finally made, but not before Mr. Coburn hinted that he
could not afford to burn a quart of oil in order that his customers
might see how to spend two cents, and with a peppermint stick in one
hand and a lemon stick in the other Tim left the store, followed by Sam
and preceded by Tip.</p>

<p>To make a fair division of the sweet feast was quite as great a task as
the purchase had been, and it was begun in the gravest manner.</p>

<p>The two sticks were carefully measured, and by the aid of Sam's
half-bladed jackknife broken at the proper place. A large rock by the
side of the road served as seat, and there the two boys munched away as
slowly as possible, in order that the feast might be prolonged to the
utmost.</p>

<p>Tip sat close by, watching every mouthful in a hungry way, but refusing
the portion Tim offered him.</p>

<p>Now that the feast was fast fading away into only a remembrance, the
thought of where he was to spend the night began to trouble Tim again,
and he asked, anxiously, "Sure your father will let me sleep in the
barn?"</p>

<p>Before the candy had been purchased, the fat boy had been perfectly sure
Tim could sleep in his father's barn, but now that the dainty was in his
possession, he began to have some doubts on the subject.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do," he said, his mouth so full of candy that
Tim could hardly understand him. "Father an' mother will be in bed when
we get home, an' it won't be any use to bother 'em. You come right up
stairs to bed with me, an' we'll fix it in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'd rather ask them, an' sleep in the barn," said Tim, not half liking
this plan.</p>

<p>"But they'll be asleep, an' you can't," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Then I'd rather go in the barn anyway."</p>

<p>"Now see here," said Sam, with an air of wisdom, as he sucked the
remaining particles of candy from his fingers, "I know father an' mother
better 'n you do, don't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tim, glad that Sam had made one statement with which he
could agree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you do jest as I tell you. We'll creep up stairs like a couple of
mice, an' in the morning I'll fix everything. Mother wouldn't want you
to sleep in the barn when you could come with me as well as not; an' you
do as I tell you."</p>

<p>It did not seem to Tim that he could do anything else, and he said, as
he slid down from the rock, "I'll do it, Sam, but I'd rather you'd ask
them."</p>

<p>Sam, content with having gained his point, walked silently along with
Tim by his side, and followed by Tip, who acted as if he knew he was
going out to spend the night without a proper invitation.</p>

<p>When they reached the house, not a light was to be seen, and the three
crept up stairs, not quite as softly as mice, but so quietly that Mr.
and Mrs. Simpson did not hear them.</p>

<p>That night Sam, Tim, and Tip lay on one bed, and neither of them lost
any sleep by thinking of his possible reception in the morning.</p>

<h3>BY AUNT MARJORIE PRECEPT.</h3>

<h3>ABOUT BEING OBLIGING.</h3>

<p>Did you ever think that a person may be very selfish and very unselfish
at the same time? Ethel is very fond of making presents to her friends.
If Edith or Nannie admires a work-box, a book, or a pencil of hers, it
is at her service. She delights to surprise her school-mates with little
gifts, and often Mattie finds a bunch of violets on her desk, which have
come from Ethel's conservatory, or a great golden orange is added to
Sadie's luncheon, and it is sure to have been brought from Florida by
Ethel's Uncle Tom. Ethel is full of kind thoughts, and is as liberal and
generous as possible with things that cost her nothing. But still I do
not regard her as unselfish, and I will tell you why.</p>

<p>She is not the least bit obliging. If she is seated in her little rocker
by the south window, and mamma or auntie comes in, ever so tired, it
does not occur to Ethel to offer her chair, that either of the ladies
may rest. Indeed, if you hint it to her, she shakes her head and says,
"There are plenty of chairs in the room; why should I give up mine?" Not
long since Cousin Polly and little Agnes Lee arrived unexpectedly, and
as there were other guests in the house, mamma was compelled to ask
Ethel to give up her pretty room, and sleep for the night with her
younger sister. Would you believe it, Ethel was so vexed that she pouted
and sulked in Cousin Polly's face, would take no notice of the child,
and finally cried herself to sleep? Not one of the family ever dreams of
asking Ethel to run up stairs or down on an errand, to mend a ripped
glove, to carry a message, or to do the slightest thing which will put
her out of her usual way. They know that she is not an obliging girl,
and, strangely enough, the very school-mates who accept her flowers and
oranges, are much more fond of Mary Ann, a plain, dumpy little body, who
never has anything to give away, but who is always greeting everybody
with kind looks and words, and who, wherever she goes, is helping along.</p>

<p>Waterview is in West Virginia. It overlooks the Great Kanawha River, and
a very pretty river it is, too. You would think so if you were permitted
to look out of any of the eastern windows of Waterview some bright
summer morning, and see the willow and plane trees nodding to you from
the opposite shore, and opening here and there to give you a glimpse of
beautiful hills crowned with snowy clouds and bright blue sky.</p>

<p>And maybe if your eye chanced to rest on the cabin just at the foot of
those beautiful hills, with its white-washed face peeping out of the
maze of green and gold that almost hid it from view, you <i>might</i> wish to
live there, even though the only way to bring it about would be by
exchanging homes and natures with Jim, the Ferry Boy.</p>

<p>Jim was the light of that little cabin&mdash;yes, the <i>light</i>, for though his
skin was as dark as the dusk, his happy and contented spirit shone out
of his laughing eyes like sunbeams breaking through the chinks in a
black cloud.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/ill_012.jpg" width="435" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He was the ferryman at Waterview&mdash;a boy, and yet a man in all that was
needed to fit him for his calling, being strong, courageous, and
faithful. To be sure, "the ferry" was nothing more than a skiff of
one-boy power, but it called upon Jim to get up at all hours of the
night, and face the wettest kind of storms and the roughest kind of
people, and these elements would have taken all the picnic flavor out of
the business for you.</p>

<p>It was all the same to Jim, however. You could shake him out of the
knottiest of naps, and drop him into the dingiest of nights, and he
would take hold of the oars with as good a will as any of you would
reach out for a box of bonbons. But with not quite as good a will,
perhaps, as he would take to an old family fiddle during the gaps
between work. His "mammy" insisted upon it that Jim got his good-nature
out of that fiddle.</p>

<p>"Dar's a drefile heap o' fun in dem chil'en w'en dey's togedder," she
would say; "and wedder Jim stirs de fiddle or de fiddle stirs Jim dar's
no tellin', on'y dey tickles each udder mos' pow'ful, now I tells yer."</p>

<p>And it is a little circumstance connected with that very same fiddle
that I have undertaken to tell you of. You see, Jim had a habit of
taking that instrument with him on his trips across the river, and when
waiting for a passenger he would prop himself up on the shore end of his
boat, and coax "Dan Tucker" and "Clar de Kitchen" out of the strings in
a way that might have made the frogs dance if there had been any one
else about to call off the figures.</p>

<p>Well, on one occasion Jim had just laid his fiddle on the bank to help a
passenger aboard, when a signal from the other side of the river caught
his eye, and in his haste to get over and "bag his game" he rowed away
without his old musical friend. On a bluff overlooking this part of the
river, standing at his doorway, as Jim moved away, was Colonel Turner;
and seeing the deserted fiddle lying on the ground, under cover of the
trees and rocks along shore he stole down there, captured it, and
brought it into the house. You see, he had a joke in mind.</p>

<p>Among his household goods was an old bass-viol&mdash;one of those very,
<i>very</i> big fiddles you have seen in orchestras, that keeps a man bobbing
up and down over its giant body like a washer-woman doing her best to
rub the wrinkles out of a wash-board.</p>

<p>Well, the Colonel took that out of its hiding-place, and in a few
moments it was lying in the very spot whence he had taken Jim's queer
little music-box.</p>

<p>Presently the swarthy young ferryman came paddling across with his
passenger, and running his boat into the little cove his frequent
landings had cut in the river-bank, landed fairly on shore before he
discovered the bass-viol lying there, with its great neck reaching out
toward the river as if to take a drink.</p>

<p>Was he surprised? You would have thought so if you had seen his eyes
bulge out, and his mouth open in a way that suggested the yawn of an
alligator, as he exclaimed, "Sakes! how dat fiddle's growed!"</p>

<p>Then, with a degree of reverence in keeping with the measure of his
surprise, Jim walked about from side to side of the monster, and finally
ventured to reach out and thrum one of the great strings. If it had been
run through him it could not have shaken him more than did the whirring
sound which followed, and caused him to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Massy me! I done feel de ruts ob dat note movin' 'way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span> down un'er my
heel!' Lucky I warn't big 'nuff ter set de hull machine go'in', else
dar'd been a earfquake sho' 'nuff.&mdash;Hullo dar!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused of the fact that his interest in the
wonderful growth of the fiddle had caused him to forget his boat, which
had meanwhile drifted from shore, and was being carried down stream as
rapidly as a rather brisk current could bear it.</p>

<p>Before the Colonel (who was watching the comedy from his doorway)
suspected his intention, the little ferryman had seized an oar that was
lying on the bank, launched the big fiddle, and, astraddle of its
bridge, was vigorously paddling in the wake of the escaping truant.</p>

<p>"Hey! you Jim!" shouted the Colonel, "where are you going with that
fiddle?"</p>

<p>"Whar de fiddle's gwine wid me, I 'speck," was Jim's response, as he
glanced back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"But don't you know the water'll shrink that machine, and take all the
music out of it?"</p>

<p>"Hit'll stan' a heap o' shrimpin', Kurnel, 'fo' it gits back ter my
meshure; but dis chile's <i>bizness</i> won't stan' any shrimpin', an' dat's
why I's ticklar 'bout dat ar boat. Bizness 'fo' pleshure, Kurnel."</p>

<p>Did he catch the boat? He was gaining on it when they turned a bend in
the river, and it is very likely he caught it. At least he "caught it"
from the Colonel when he came back with that soaked fiddle.</p>

<p>On the first day of June the public swimming-baths in New York city were
opened for the season. It is only a few years since the "City Fathers,"
as the Board of Aldermen are sometimes called, came to see the advantage
of providing places where those of their children whose lives are passed
in crowded tenement-houses and hot, dirty streets could wash and be
clean. The aldermen built schools and paid teachers, and thought they
had done their duty; but cleanliness is next to godliness, and health is
even more important than reading and writing. The bath-tub is not in
great favor with persons who have not been brought up to it, but every
boy and girl likes to paddle about in the water in hot weather; and
where there is a chance to swim, very few will long be content with
paddling. Swimming is natural to most land animals, and a man could swim
as readily as they but that he lacks confidence. It is very easily
learned, however, and when learned, how delightful and healthy an
accomplishment it is! and to what noble deeds does it not open the way!</p>

</div>

<p>You will read in the newspapers from time to time of persons who have
risked their lives to stop runaway horses, or to rescue helpless persons
from an awful death in a burning house; but the heroes who have
distinguished themselves by saving life in the water far outnumber
those; for among a travelling people such as ours, danger by water is
much more frequent than fires, or any other situations where the act of
a single person may save life. Prince Bismarck, the great German
Chancellor, may cover the breast of his uniform with medals and stars
and orders of knighthood; but the decoration which he wears most
frequently, and values more highly than all, is a medal which he
received for rescuing his groom from drowning many years ago.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/ill_016.jpg" width="240" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">FISHING.</span>
</div>

<p>There is a story of a loving and overcautious mother who forbade her
children to go into the water until they had learned to swim. Of course
it is impossible for any one to swim before he has had an opportunity of
trying; but in the absence of a teacher, a beginner will learn much more
easily if he studies the positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span> and movements as given in the
following hints. The first rule in learning to swim is, take things
coolly. Remember that you can swim naturally if you can only put aside
all nervousness and excitement.</p>

<p>Salt-water is the best to swim in on account of its greater buoyancy,
but it is very difficult to learn in the surf. If you bathe in still or
running water, be careful to choose a place free from weeds, and with a
hard bottom, sloping gradually down to deep water. Be cautious about
holes which would take you over your head, especially when bathing in an
unknown place. Never venture out into deep water trusting to corks or
life-belts to keep you afloat. Such help will never teach you to swim,
and may lead you into danger. You need have no fear of taking cold <i>in</i>
the water; but if you stay in long enough to get chilled, you will most
likely take cold when you come out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/ill_017.jpg" width="269" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">A JUMP FROM THE ROOF.</span>
</div>

<p>If you find that you do not get warm as soon as you are dressed, you may
be sure you have staid in the water too long, and your bath has done you
more harm than good.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to think that swimming is a sport solely for men
and boys; for not only do those girls who learn to swim enjoy doing so,
but it is quite as important for girls to know how to swim as for boys.
Nearly every large city is provided with swimming-baths, private and
public, where every facility is afforded for swimming and learning to
swim. In New York city there are seventeen of these baths, nine of them
private, to which a small admission fee is charged, and eight of them
public. In the private baths certain compartments are always reserved
for women and girls, and the public baths are devoted to their use on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>

<p>On the preceding page are a number of sketches made by Mrs. Shepherd in
one of the largest of these public baths. Some of the girls who visit
these baths become very expert swimmers, and think nothing of taking a
flying leap from the roof of the bath-house, swimming the entire length
of the bath under the water, and doing other feats that appear very
wonderful to the little ones just learning to swim by the aid of lines
made fast to their waists.</p>

<h4>ENTERING THE WATER.</h4>

<p>Enter the water until as deep as your waist, when you can stoop and duck
your head and the rest of your body; then advancing until the water
reaches to your breast, turn your face toward the shore. This direction
is given to increase your confidence, as you must remember that as you
advance you are getting into shallower water.</p>

<p>Leaning gradually forward, extend your arms, keeping your hands together
sideways, the thumbs close together, and the palms slightly turned from
you; and just as your chin touches the surface of the water, draw a long
breath, at the same time bringing your hands round toward your sides. If
you do this steadily and regularly, you will find your feet leave the
bottom, and that you have succeeded in supporting yourself. You may not
do this at the first attempt, or even at the second or third; but that
will be because your heart has failed you, and you have made the motion
too quickly or irregularly.</p>

<p>If you have not yet acquired that perfect confidence necessary to enable
you to become a swimmer, you may at first allow one foot to touch the
ground; but if you find you can manage without doing so, so much the
better.</p>

<h4>THE STROKE.</h4>

<p>At the same time that you bring your arms back to your sides, you must
draw up your legs, and extending your arms again as in the first
movement, strike your feet out steadily behind you.</p>

<p>The action of the legs in swimming is most important. The strokes should
come from the knees, not from the hips, the feet spreading wide apart,
and striking backward and downward, in order to obtain the greatest
amount of resistance from the water, and the ankle-joints firm.</p>

<p>When you have learned the stroke with the arms and that with the legs,
you are able to swim. Always make your strokes with steadiness, and not
too rapidly, taking a fresh breath every time you strike out. After all,
you will find hard-and-fast rules on this subject are not of much use,
as you will soon naturally breathe at the right time.</p>

<h4>SWIMMING ON THE BACK.</h4>

<p>In order to swim on your back, you must, of course, first turn over.
This is done exactly as you turn in bed. Drop the arm and leg opposite
to the side to which you turn, and embrace, as it were, the water with
the other. This movement seems very difficult, but it is a perfectly
<i>natural</i> one, and you have only to obey the impulse of your will in
order to perform it.</p>

<p>Having turned over, let your head lie well back, no other part of your
body being out of the water, the hands close to the hips, and then
strike out with the feet as directed in your first lesson in breast
swimming.</p>

<p>In swimming on your back you can use your hands in various ways, as you
may desire to go faster or slower. If in no haste, merely paddling with
them by the sides of your hips will greatly assist, or you can push them
down from the waist toward your thighs, bringing them back edgewise, so
as to offer as little resistance as possible to the water. But the
greatest speed while swimming on your back is to be attained by
stretching both hands as far as possible out of the water behind your
head, and bringing them with a rapid sweep edgewise into the water
again, opposing your palms to the water, so as to get as great a
pressure as possible. You can, of course, at the same time use your
legs, though you can progress by the use of your arms alone, but with
nothing like the same speed.</p>

<h4>RESTING&mdash;FLOATING.</h4>

<p>In swimming you often want to rest yourself, and this is done by <i>change
of action</i>. It is surprising the amount of relief a tired swimmer finds
by merely changing the manner of progression; the different sets of
muscles it brings into play afford ease to those he had hitherto been
using; in fact, in long distances this is one way in which a swimmer has
moments of rest.</p>

<p>The greatest change is naturally that from vigorous exertion to perfect
repose, that is, floating. In order to float, keep your head well back,
and straighten your legs, which will naturally drop a little downward;
you can either stretch your arms behind your head, or if you are really
floating to rest yourself, and not merely trying to lie flat on the
water, you can cross them behind your back.</p>

<p>In this latter position they give increased buoyancy to the head and
upper part of the body, and you will find it also enables you to breathe
more freely, and to look around you.</p>

<h4>SIDE SWIMMING.</h4>

<p>For a short distance the greatest speed can be attained by swimming on
the side.</p>

<p>Start in the usual manner on your breast, and, when off, incline to your
right side, presenting that side of your head and that arm to the water,
striking out with it to the full extent, the motion of your legs
continuing the same as when starting; but your left shoulder being now
out of the water, your left arm must be used by being thrown out as far
as you can, without stretching, and drawn back as you make your stroke,
the hand being hollowed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span> the action is, in fact, that of <i>pulling</i>
yourself through the water.</p>

<p>If you follow our directions, and keep up your courage, you will have
gained such confidence that you will no longer have any dread of the
water, and will be able to swim on your face, your back, and your side,
as well as to rest yourself by a change from one style to another, or by
floating.</p>

<h2>A BIT OF FOOLISHNESS.</h2>

<h3>BY SARAH O. JEWETT.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part II</span>.</h3>

<p>The wind suddenly grew very cold, and blew the trees angrily, and turned
their leaves the wrong way, until it seemed like a furious storm. It had
been still, and the sun had been hot and glaring, but suddenly the air
felt like autumn, and our friends looked around every now and then to
see the shower chasing them, and covering the hills and woods with heavy
white mist. The fragrance of the wet pine woods was very sweet, and the
coolness was delightful, but the clouds looked strangely yellow, and as
if a great deal of rain would pour out of them presently, while there
were flashes of lightning every now and then, and distant thunder began
to growl among the mountains.</p>

<p>"It will be here in a few minutes," said Jack, looking at his sister
anxiously. "I'm awfully sorry, Alice." And they both hurried; as if by
walking fast they could get away from the rain. "And our clothes have
all gone to North Conway! how shall we ever get dry?" he added,
ruefully; but Alice laughed.</p>

<p>"You know we were all drenched coming home from Gorham that day. It
wasn't very bad, and it won't be chilly like this for very long, at any
rate."</p>

<p>The first great drops of the rain began to spatter among the leaves, and
our friends found the shower at first very refreshing, but when their
clothes became so soaked that the weight of them was something
surprising, and streams of water began to run along the road, they did
not like it so well; but they made the best of it, and laughed heartily,
though they were both beginning to feel very tired, and wondered if
there would never be an end to the woods. It was growing darker too, and
if some one did not drive by before long, it would be most discouraging.
Early in the afternoon they had passed several loaded carts, besides
pleasure parties that were driving to or from the Glen House, but for
some time there had not been a traveller on that part of the road except
themselves.</p>

<p>The rain ceased falling; it had been a heavy shower, but luckily it did
not last long. They had taken shelter under a great beech-tree when it
had become altogether too hard work to walk, and Alice wrung the water
out of her skirts as well as she could, and they started on again.</p>

<p>The clouds looked very heavy, and the sunset was a very pale one, and it
seemed to be growing dark early. In that deep valley the twilight begins
much sooner than out in the open country, and Jack and Alice had lost so
much time already that they were a good way from the house they meant to
reach by seven o'clock, and just after that time Alice said,
despairingly:</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can walk much further, Jack. I'm ashamed to give in,
but I don't think I ever was so tired in all my life."</p>

<p>"I'm tired myself," said Jack; "it's the hardest walking I ever did; but
I suppose there is nothing to do but to go on. I think it's very odd
that it is so long since we have passed anybody."</p>

<p>Alice went on without saying any more for a little while, but at last
she sat down by the road-side, while Jack stood at her side and waited
uneasily.</p>

<p>"I think we are getting out of the track of the shower," said he.
"Suppose we go on a little further, and find a good dry place, and build
a camp fire, and get dry and rested at any rate. I begin to feel like an
old jelly-fish trying to roll along on his edge."</p>

<p>Alice laughed, and started out again. It was really getting to be drier
footing, and the air felt warmer, and it was not long before Jack
touched the earth with his hand, and said that he was sure there could
be nothing but dew on the ground, and they might as well stop. They
listened and listened for the sound of wheels, but even the thrushes had
stopped singing, and all they could hear was a brook tumbling over the
ledges, and the cry of a hawk or an owl far in the woods.</p>

<p>Jack chose a safe place at the side of a great rock, where there seemed
to be no danger of setting the woods on fire. It was so dark they could
scarcely see, but they heaped up a pile of pine-needles and dry twigs
and birch bark, and it seemed very cheerful when they had lighted it.
Jack was delighted because Alice had some little wax matches in the bag
he carried on his shoulder, and I think the first flicker of the fire
gave a great pleasure to both our friends.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find some larger wood," said Jack, "and then I am going to
cook the fish. I shall starve to death. We are like the Babes in the
Wood, aren't we? Get as near to the fire as you can, Alice, and you'll
soon be dry."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/ill_018.jpg" width="387" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="caption">TRYING TO GET DRY.</span>
</div>

<p>They had a magnificent blaze before very long, and Alice hung her jacket
and wet, heavy skirt on stakes beside it. They were in a little open
place not far from the road, and Jack began to tell stories of his
experiences the summer before when he had been off on a fishing and
camping-out excursion with some friends in the Maine woods.</p>

<p>Alice had heard them all before, but they were none the less
interesting. She had always wished to camp out herself, and this
experience was, after all, a great satisfaction, now that she was a
little rested, and was getting dry and comfortable. It was not so bad to
be damp even, but she hated the thought of going any further that night.</p>

<p>In the lunch-box there were still some hard crackers and a paper of
salt, and after Jack had baked his three trout&mdash;and he did not do it
badly either, for a guide had taught him once how to wrap them in some
leaves and dig a little place in the hot ashes for an oven&mdash;they ate
their supper, and were as jolly as possible. The fire was a great
success; they had gathered all the old dry wood they could find, and at
last they were willing to let it go down, for it was growing too hot:
the night was warm at any rate. They sat together on the slope and
leaned against the rock. The trout had been very good&mdash;they only wished
there had been more; but they were very comfortable, and they watched
the strange shadows the flickering light of the fire made among the
trees. They were neither of them a bit afraid, and presently Jack was
silent for a few moments, and his sister found that he had gone to
sleep.</p>

<p>She would not wake him, she thought; he might sleep a little while just
as well as not, and they could go on if they liked an hour later. By
that time the moon would be up, too. Alice looked up through the
branches at the stars; there was an old hemlock almost overhead that was
like a roof, but there seemed to be very little dew falling.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes were beginning to be troublesome, now that the fire was
down, and she said to herself that she would get some more wood
presently if Jack did not wake&mdash;and in three minutes more she was as
sound asleep as Jack himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span></p>

<p>He waked first; it was late in the night, and the moon was high in the
sky. The fire was out, and at first he could not think where he was; but
Alice was there, sure enough, and the hemlock-tree, and the rest of the
woods. He felt a little stiff and chilly, and he started to his feet to
look around, and suddenly he heard two or three roosters crowing, and at
that sound he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Alice! Alice!" said he; and his sister waked quickly, but was even more
bewildered at first than he had been.</p>

<p>"I never slept better in my life," she said, sleepily. "There's nothing
the matter, is there, Jack? Ought we to go on, do you think? I am as
stiff as Rip Van Winkle, and my arm is sound asleep." And she sat up and
rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to those old roosters?" asked Jack, going into fits of
laughter, and Alice laughed too. "There must be a house close by," he
told her, "and we thought we were cast away. I suppose if we had walked
ten minutes longer, we must have seen it." And they gathered up their
possessions and took the road again. I do not think they cared to take
another nap on the ground. Jack said that the mosquitoes had had their
Christmas dinner in summer that year, and though he did not confess it,
his neck was very stiff, and they both began to sneeze with great
energy.</p>

<p>There was really a small house about an eighth of a mile away, and our
friends walked about it and surveyed it in the moonlight. A sleepy
little yellow dog appeared and barked at them, and after Jack had
pounded at the door for some minutes, some one opened a window and asked
what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Can you take two people in for the night?"</p>

<p>"'Deed I can't," said the woman, snappishly. "We don't keep tavern.
Young fellows like you better be to home this time o' night. Trampin', I
s'pose, ain't ye? The men-folks is all to home here, so ye needn't try
to scare me."</p>

<p>"I'm not a tramp," mentioned Jack, with great dignity and politeness.
"We started to walk through from the Glen, but the shower stopped us a
while, and it got dark, and we didn't know we were near any houses until
we heard your roosters crowing. We've been asleep in the woods."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the woman, in a different tone. And after a minute's
meditation, she added: "Well, you kin go into the barn, I s'pose, and
sleep on the hay&mdash;on your right hand 's you go in; it's new hay. We
ain't got a spare bed in the house. I do' know's I kin do any better for
ye."</p>

<p>Alice was in the shadow, and at some little distance from the house, and
she and Jack laughed as they went to the barn. "She said there was some
new hay, didn't she?" Alice asked. And as they laid themselves down in
it, it seemed a most luxurious bed. There was an old horse in the barn,
who looked at them with astonishment as they opened the door, and the
dim light shone in upon him. The dust made Alice sneeze worse than ever,
and she watched the moon shining through the cracks of the barn, and
after a good while she went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Early in the morning somebody came to the door, and our friends waked
unwillingly.</p>

<p>"My good land sakes alive!" said the woman who had talked to them from
the window. "Why didn't ye say there was a lady with ye? I looked round
for your mate, and I couldn't see nothing o' nobody. I took it for
granted ye were two young fellows, and I was all sole alone. My man's
gone down to North Conway, and I thought I wouldn't bother to get up and
let ye in. Well, I am mortified and ashamed. You should ha' had the best
I got. I hope ye ain't got your death o' cold. 'Twas a warm night,
though. Wan't ye eat up with 'skeeters? Why hadn't ye spoke, young man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jack. "I supposed you knew. I didn't think. My
sister was right out in the yard there." And they all laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll get ye some breakfast anyway," said the woman, who seemed very
good-natured that morning, though she had been so cross the night
before. "I've got a nice young fowl picked all ready, and I'll have her
fried with a bit o' pork in no time at all. Come into the house now,
won't ye?"</p>

<p>Such a breakfast as our friends ate that morning! and such a pleasant
ride as they had to North Conway afterward! for Mrs. Dummer, their
hostess, was going there to meet her husband, who had gone down some
days before. It was too hot, they thought, to walk the rest of the way,
and yet there was a fine breeze blowing. I think they were a little
tired after their experience the night before, but they were young and
strong, and the wetting did not do them a bit of harm after all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dummer brushed and cleaned Alice's dress for her&mdash;at least they did
it together. It was blue flannel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span> made short in the skirt, and so,
after it had its crumples taken out by a little ironing, it looked as
well as ever.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dummer seemed much excited by their adventures, and she was sorry
to part with her guests. She had not been married very long, she said;
she had lived at North Conway in a boarding-house for several years, and
it was a great deal livelier there in the summer-time. She did not know
how she was going to like living 'way up in the woods on that lonely
farm after cold weather came. But she said, shyly, that "he" was real
good company, and that her sister was going to spend part of the winter
with her.</p>

<p>"If you would come and stop a while some time, he'd take you off
fishing," she told Jack; "he's a great hand to go off for trout." And
Jack promised to remember the invitation the next summer.</p>

<p>It seemed an uncommon adventure at the time, and our friends enjoyed it
on the whole, only they were sorry afterward they had not walked all the
way to North Conway, and poor Jack never has ceased to mourn because
nobody can ever know how much his big trout weighed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am a little girl five years old, named Emma. I have lived over a
year in France with papa and mamma and my little sister, although
we were all born in America. Our home is on the beautiful river
Seine, near Paris.</p>

<p>I have already crossed the great Atlantic Ocean three times. My
grandpa in America has taken <span class="smcap">Harper's Young People</span> for me since the
first number, and my mamma reads many of the stories to us. I have
asked mamma to write and tell you some of the sights of every-day
life in France. I can neither read nor write myself, but I will
tell mamma what to write about, and she will express it better than
I could. The French people enjoy living out-of-doors. If they have
only a tiny garden no larger than some of our grass-plots in
America, they buy an iron table, chairs enough for the family, and
perhaps two or three others for relatives or friends who may come
to take a meal with them, and then they eat out-of-doors, enjoying
themselves around these little tables in the garden more than they
would staying in the house.</p>

<p>They are easily pleased, these French people, in the country. In
the summer they have many charming fêtes. Every little town or
village in France has, at some time during the warm weather, a
fête. A convenient piece of land is taken possession of or else
rented by the authorities in charge of the fête. They sub-let small
portions of the land just large enough for each merchant to erect a
table upon, like our tables at fairs in America. The merchants
bring their families with them, for the fête lasts several days.
They sleep in the large wagons in which they bring their articles
for sale, and they set up little stoves, each with a long pipe
attached, and there the women cook their meals. The "draught"
out-doors is sometimes very troublesome, and the poor women have
hard times to prepare their dinners. Each merchant spreads out his
array of goods on his table in as tempting a manner as possible,
and over each table is arranged a little shed to protect the goods
in case of rain.</p>

<p>At these fêtes in the country one meets all the world. There are
the doctors, the lawyers, and all the grand people, as much amused
and pleased as the laborer in his blue blouse. Besides the tables
of goods, there are many funny things to make people laugh. There
are balloons sent up in the air&mdash;not great balls shaped like
immense pears, but made to represent men, women, and little boys
and girls. These are colored to show their faces and hair, their
bright waists, skirts, or trousers, and then they are inflated with
gas and sent off in the air. They look very funny as they float
away higher than the houses and trees, like great fat men, women,
and children. I have been at fêtes with my mamma, and have seen
gentlemen and ladies laughing as merrily as the peasants at these
droll balloons. Sometimes, when not properly inflated, they come
tumbling down, and then the spectators fairly scream with delight.</p>

<p>At the fêtes, too, they have odd-looking circus tents, where for
fifty centimes (ten cents of American money) one can see the
poorest circus shows imaginable. There are queer views of all
kinds&mdash;fires, murders, and earthquakes. These exhibitions may be
seen for about three cents.</p>

<p>The other day we saw at a fête a sort of panoramic view of what
goes on in a person's stomach after eating salt pork sent from
America. The French government is opposed to receiving salt or
smoked pork from America, because it is said that trichinæ have
been discovered in it. In this exhibition we were shown the stomach
as it should be, and the stomach after its owner had eaten American
pork. The effect was very startling, the various organs and
intestines twisting about in the most bewildering manner possible.</p>

<p>They have wooden horses with women's heads of different
nationalities, French, German, African, and Russian. These wooden
horses go round very rapidly, a real horse turning the machinery
which sets them in motion. You can have a nice ride for two cents,
to the music of a hand-organ.</p>

<p>But I shall weary you if I tell you any more. Perhaps I will write
again, and describe more of the life of the people who dwell in
sunny France.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to tell you about my little rooster. He is a very pretty
brown color, so we call him Brownie; and one of the story-books
says that Brownies used to be good to little babies, and that's
another reason why we gave him the name. Now I'll tell you what he
did to deserve being named after a Brownie. My mamma bought him to
eat; but he got away, and, the next day here he came fussing and
scratching with five baby chicks&mdash;three of them little downy
fellows, the other two a little older&mdash;with their little tails and
wings just growing. He took the best care of those chickens. It was
funny to see him. He was only just broiling size himself, but he
would ruffle up and try to fight big hens if they came too near. He
didn't know how to brood over his babies, but he would sit down and
let them snuggle under his wings and feathers the best way they
could. He doesn't know how to cluck, either; but he makes his
little rooster sounds in the nicest, softest little voice you ever
heard. There's one old hen&mdash;old Graywhack we call her, because
she's gray and whacks all the other chickens&mdash;and she's so cross
that all the rest are afraid of her, and run away, cocks and all,
when she comes up to them. But Brownie doesn't; he bustles up and
makes almost as much fuss as she does, and this always, though he
gets a whack now and then.</p>

<p>His biggest chicks are big enough to take care of themselves now,
and they are so pretty, both little black hens, and we call them
Nig and Blackie. The cats killed one while it was little, but he
still has two, and takes as good care of them as ever. He is
learning to crow first-rate now, though sometimes he squawks
awfully.</p>

<p>Mamma reads me all the stories every week, but I like "Toby Tyler"
best of all, and I think the man who shot Mr. Stubbs ought to have
been very sorry.</p>

<p>My mamma wrote this for me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have twenty-five different kinds of birds' wings that I would

an Indian flint arrow-head and spear-head, iron, copper, and gold
ore, white sand from Galveston Bar, Texas, gray sand from Cape
Hatteras, sea-shells, barnacles from a wreck, fresh-water shells,
etc.; would like to exchange for other minerals, ores, fossils, and
petrifactions. Write before exchanging.</p>

<p>I have never walked, being paralyzed in my lower limbs from birth,
yet I manage to get around. I have a team of white goats, Billy and
Bob. With them I go gunning, and travel sometimes five or six
miles. I enjoy fishing and boat-riding. I built myself a little
skiff, and called her <i>Little Eva</i>, and in this I sail out of the
Brandywine into the broad waters of the Delaware, and am often gone
for hours. I have lots of fun, although I never took a step in my
life. I am always jolly. I have served papers for three years, and
make from three to four dollars a week. I did not lose a day last
winter; no matter how cold or snowy, my customers would always know
that Johnny and his well-known team would be faithful. I will send
a photograph of myself and team to editor if desired.</p></blockquote>

<p>The picture you give of a brave sunny disposition, which makes the best
of things, instead of pining and fretting, is a very attractive one. We
hardly need the photograph of yourself and your sturdy team, because
your pen has made us see you quite plainly. Still, if you send the
photograph, we will be glad to look at it, and it shall be given a place
of honor at the head-quarters of the Post-office Box. Never to have
taken a step in one's life seems like a great hardship, but instead of
moping about it, you have resolved to be as busy, useful, and happy as
you can. No wonder your customers wait until you are ready to come along
to serve the papers. We are glad you can go for a sail in the skiff, and
that you have so many pleasures and resources.</p>

<p>But, Johnny, we are sorry that you shoot the birds, and we fear you do,
or else how have you collected so many birds' wings? We wish the little
girls who read Our Post-office Box would decide that when they grow up
they would wear no wings nor plumes in their hats, and that the boys
would all resolve to be bird protectors. If any who read your letter are
possessed of pretty feathers or wings, we shall not object to their
exchanging with you, but we do not want to think that any poor birds
will be deprived of their lives, on purpose, because of this. We are
glad to print your letter, birds' wings and all, on account of its
manliness, and the lesson it gives us to accept the situation, whatever
it is, and do our duty in it cheerfully.</p>

<p>I live on an orange grove on the St. Johns River. I read the story

named Jetty. She is black and tan. I have a Coachy rooster also.</p>

<p>My little brother has a yellow hen that we raised, and he calls her
Greeny. Whenever he tries to catch her, she stops right still till
he has her. She always pecks anything he is eating. She used to lay
in the house, but she don't now, because we won't let her.</p>

<p>I have a large copper cent of 1818 and one of 1819; also, some
Florida moss, water from the St. Johns, and an ounce of soil. I
will exchange any of these things for foreign stamps, coins, Indian
relics, and curiosities of any kind.</p></blockquote>

Many, many thanks for the books you have sent; thanks, too, for the
kind notes and letters that some of you wrote. It would give me
great pleasure to see you all, and talk with you. The old numbers
of <span class="smcap">Young People</span> will all be new to these children. Dear Fred and

all of you who help, inside the house. It will seem that you are
sharing in the good work if your names are in view, and it may be
that in the days to come some of you may find your way to this
out-of-the-world place, and see the fruits of the dimes you are now

<h4>AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>I accept the office of President of The Young People's Natural
History Society, and will do all in my power to make it a success.
I am in a dilemma about how long my term of office will extend. As
I am only a boy, I have some fears that I may not prove equal to
the position, but I will do my best.</p>

<p>In regard to girls, I would say certainly admit them.</p>

<p>The question of money will, perhaps, cause discussion. Some persons
think that regular dues should be paid into the treasury every
week, or whenever a branch meets; others think that an initiation
fee of twenty-five cents should be paid whenever a new member
joins. I would advise to charge no dues nor initiation fees
whatever. If any necessary expenses occur, they can be met by a
personal contribution by any member, or by mutual consent of the
members of the special branch it can be settled in any way&mdash;except
as above&mdash;they may deem proper.</p>

<p>To our city members who are now in the mountains or by the sea-side
I would say, Keep your eyes open, and find out all you can about
what you see, and let us know all about it. To our country members,
and those who do not reside in the large cities, I would say, Be
especially diligent in finding objects of interest, study them
well, and report to us your progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span></p>

<p>You can find on the salt-meadows and along the sea-shore the bench
pea and the wild bean, and many quaint prickly plants, such as the
salt-wort and samphire; there are also the sabbatia, marsh-mallow,
and rose-mallow. In the fresh-water swamps and ponds, the swamp
milkweed, button-bush, the balsams, cardinal-flower (gorgeous in
its red), and near it the great blue lobelia, wild yellow lily,
sun-dews, blue veronicas, arrow-heads, pickerel-weeds, sweet-flags,
and cat-tails. On the hill-sides and shady ravines, the flaming
azaleas, the great laurel, the aromatic winter-green, pine-sap, and
the coral-root. In the rocky woodlands there are countless
varieties of asters, golden-rods, thoroughworts, and corn-flowers.</p>

<p>There are many other varieties growing all over the land, in the
shady glens, in the sunny meadows, or in the forests, and even on
the summits of our highest mountains.</p>

<p>In answer to some young folks in the West about grafting
rose-bushes, etc., I give below what a prominent pomologist
recently told me.</p>

<p>He said that the first thing necessary was a sharp flat-bladed
knife, which should be kept for this purpose only. If it does not
cut smooth and clean, the two edges will not fit well together. He
then cut a graft, having cut off a branch of a bush to correspond;
the two were matched as nearly as possible, and bound tightly
together by a plaster spread with grafting wax, which can be
procured from any farmer or at a seed store. The object of this was
to keep the sap in, and to exclude all moisture, which would be
sure to cause decay in the wood.</p>

<p>One or two other styles were shown and explained, such as <i>tongue</i>
and cleft grafting. The graft itself is cut like a wedge, and a
cleft made in the centre of the stock, into which the slender point
should be fitted closely, and then well covered up with wax. One
thing, he said, must always be remembered: the graft must be
placed, not in the centre of the cleft, but toward one side, so as
to cause the inner layers of bark to meet in a line, at least in
one place. The reason of this is very plain; for when the sap
begins to ascend into the new graft, it will follow this inner
bark, and so, in a like manner, the descending sap will soon flow
downward to form new wood, and unite firmly with its main stalk.
Instead of sending down roots into the ground, as cuttings do, it
strikes its forming wood into the stock itself, and soon becomes a
part. <i>Tongue</i> grafting, or, as some call it, whip grafting, is
done by making notches in each to correspond as nearly as possible,
and is somewhat preferred, because it is likely to hold the two
parts more closely together and in their proper places.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if any members of our society would like to have me
visit their branch in the vicinity of New York, I shall be happy to
do so, and hope that my presence there may make the meeting
pleasant and instructive; and that this letter may increase your
interest in natural history is the wish of your President,</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought I would like to tell the boys and girls where I am
spending the summer. We have a splendid cool house here in Babylon.
I go sailing, rowing, riding, and bathing. The places here are very
handsome, and many people have lakes and ponds in their grounds.
Two papers are printed here every week. We have a hotel and a
horse-car. Today we set a trap to catch a squirrel. Babylon is on
the Great South Bay, where there are all sorts of fishing and
splendid sailing; but sometimes we have very heavy squalls, and
sometimes we are becalmed. They have just finished the new railroad
dépôt, and we have a large park. There are five churches here, and
three of the Sunday-schools have an annual picnic.</p>

<p>I have no pets, except a dear little cunning baby sister, who sings
and dances very prettily. I look forward to <span class="smcap">Young People</span>'s arrival
every week, for it is very good company. I have a brother, with
whom I have great fun boating, and two sisters. We get lovely
pond-lilies in the season. They smell so sweet! Summer is the best
part of the year.</p>

<p>My father is a captain in the Seventh Regiment,
N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;I suppose some boys and
girls don't know what N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Y. stand for,
so I will tell them. Those letters mean National Guard, State of
New York. Papa's company is Company B. The armory is a very
handsome building, covering a whole square block, and each company
has a room of its own. Papa goes to the city of New York every
morning. We have spent three summers in Babylon, and are very fond
of it. I am twelve years old.</p></blockquote>

<p>H.&nbsp;H.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coffee</span>.&mdash;The coffee-tree grows wild in Asia and Africa. It
sometimes grows to a great height, but is usually kept down by cutting
to about five feet, so that the berries can be easily picked. The plant
is raised from the seed, and is set out in the coffee plantations when
one year old. It begins to bear when three years old, and continues
productive for twenty years. The leaves are evergreen, and the flowers
and fruit are often seen upon it at the same time, as, like the fig, it
bears several crops during the year. The fruit looks like a cherry, is
red or dark purple, sweet, and good to eat. The seeds of the fruit,
gathered and dried, produce our coffee beans. Coffee has been used by
Oriental nations for ages, but it was introduced into Europe about three
hundred years ago. The first coffee-house was opened in London in 1652.
A French gentleman, Captain Desclieux, brought the first coffee-plants
to America, about one hundred and fifty years ago. He procured them from
the Jardin des Plantes (Garden of Plants) in Paris. The sea was rough,
and the voyage was long, and finally the crew and passengers were put on
an allowance of drinking water; but the good captain divided his with
his coffee-trees, and succeeded in bringing one safely to Martinique.
All the coffee-plants in America came from that one.</p>

<p>Coffee is grown in Brazil, Java, Sumatra, India, Ceylon, Arabia,
Abyssinia, Central America, the West Indies, Venezuela, the United
States of Colombia, and Peru. The very best is Mocha, which comes from
Arabia; but the next best, which is good enough for epicures, is brought
from Java. A good deal of so-called Java coffee, however, comes from
Brazil, which raises half the coffee in the world.</p>

<h3>A PERSONATION: WHAT AM I?</h3>

<p>I lay imbedded in a cavern, struggling faithfully for days, weeks, and
even months, to see the light. I was rewarded for my perseverance one
day by coming in contact with a hard object, which shone brightly, and
made a ringing sound. Instantly I heard loud laughter, as though my
appearance was very welcome. Presently I felt a soft, damp substance
touch me, which at first surprised me very much; but as I found it was a
near neighbor, I soon became acquainted with it.</p>

<p>As soon as I had grown large enough to be useful, I was washed every
morning, and properly taken care of, for which I repaid my owner by
making myself as useful as possible. I had the bitter as well as the
sweets of life, but it was not until my later years that I knew what it
was to really suffer.</p>

<p>I was one day attending to my duty, when I experienced a shocking and
most acute pain, which so affected my mistress that she immediately took
me to a very kind man, who relieved me of the cause of my trouble. It
was found that I had become somewhat discolored from frequent use, so
the physician had to attend to me several times. At last he succeeded in
restoring my health, which resulted in lengthening my days; and though
rather aged, my owner still considers me of great use.</p>

<h2><a name="MUD_BOWS" id="MUD_BOWS">MUD BOWS.</a></h2>

<p>There is a form of archery in the Madras Presidency, in India, which is
popular with young British officers. The bows have two strings, with a
connecting patch in the middle. The missiles are <i>golees</i>, or balls of
sun-dried clay, a heap of which is dutifully provided every day by the
<i>malees</i>, or gardeners. The targets are usually crows, hawkers, or other
objectionable natives, or fragile and inexpensive earthen pots. Experts
attain surprising range and accuracy with these rude contrivances.
Novices are apt to smash or grievously bruise their left thumbs with the
projectile on its discharge, no little skill being required to direct it
clear of the wooden part of the bow.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FAGOTS.</h2>

<p>Disentangle the lines composing the bunch of Fagots, Fig. 1, trace each
of them carefully upon a piece of card-board, cut these into the general
shapes of the lines drawn upon them (see Fig. 2, which represents a bit
of card-board with a fagot drawn upon it), and arrange them so that the
"fagots" will form an outline drawing of an animal.</p>
